<h1>Threaded code: Literals, ifs, and loops</h1>
<hr />
</div>

<div id="content">
<p>While writing my <a href="/threaded-code/">introduction to threaded code</a> I suggested that non-leaf routines &ndash; colon words, in Forth lingo &ndash; can be represented as a list of addresses that get executed in sequence. This suggested that all code executes in a straight line and then returns to its caller. We all know this isn&rsquo;t true, but threaded code that runs in a straight line is already tricky and tedious to explain; explaining literals and control structures at the same time seemed like too much.</p>
<p>But we are here now, and we understand how threading-in-a-straight-line works, so let&rsquo;s see how loops, branches, and literals work in a threaded world.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the real world, code doesn&rsquo;t always execute in a straight line and then return &ndash; and yet, at the moment, which the machinery that we&rsquo;ve defined so far, that&rsquo;s all we can do. We also have no way to represent literal data &ndash; addresses or numbers that we might want to compute with. We can write a code word called <code class="forth">+</code> that pops two values off the data stack, adds them, and pushes the result, but if we want to add 8 to something, how do we do that?</p>
<p>With just three runtime code words we can add if/then/else, while loops, and literals to our system.</p>
<p>The names are arbitrary, but in many Forth systems the convention is to give them parenthesized names. These are not words that mere mortals normally execute; they exist as part of the hidden &ldquo;runtime fabric&rdquo; of the system. The parentheses suggest their &ldquo;underlying&rdquo; or &ldquo;runtime&rdquo; nature.</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<pre>
  (lit)      Fetch into W the address pointed to by IP
             Increment IP by address size (skip literal)
             Push W onto the data stack
             Execute NEXT
</pre>
<pre>
  (branch)   Fetch into W the address pointed to by IP
             Set IP to W
             Execute NEXT
</pre>
<pre>
  (0branch)  Pop a value off the data stack
             If the value is zero, execute (branch)
             Otherwise, increment IP by address size (skip branch address)
</pre>
<p>The <code class="forth">(branch)</code> above does an <em>absolute</em> branch. If you prefer relative branches, modify it thus:</p>
<pre>
  (branch)   Fetch into W the address pointed to by IP
             Set IP to IP + W
             Execute NEXT
</pre>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume we have a code word <code class="forth">+</code> that adds two values. To create a word that adds 8 to whatever is on the top of the stack, we would create a colon word with the following (textual) definition:</p>
<pre>
  : add8   8 +  ;
</pre>
<p>which, assuming an ITC system, would get compiled to:</p>
<pre>
  add8
  ~~~~
  address of NEST     ( all colon words start with this)
  address of (lit)
  8
  address of +
  address of UNNEST
</pre>
<p>The <code class="forth">;</code> adds the address of UNNEST at the end and ends the compilation.</p>
<p>(This is getting outside the scope of our discussion, which is about the <em>execution machinery</em>, but in Forth systems <code class="forth">;</code> has <em>two</em> tasks: to compile the address of UNNEST, and to exit &ldquo;compilation mode&rdquo; &ndash; a special mode of <em>textual</em> interpretation that is the essence of the Forth compiler &ndash; and return to normal &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo; mode.)</p>
<p>For if/then/else and looping we use <em>flag</em> values &ndash; truth values &ndash; that we compute and leave on the stack for <code class="forth">(0branch)</code> to test and consume.</p>
<p>To make this even more concrete, let&rsquo;s add five more code words to our system:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;       Pop two values off the data stack
          If the first is less than the second, push -1
          Otherwise, push 0
          Execute NEXT
</pre>
<pre>
  0=      Pop a value off the data stack
          If the value is zero, push -1
          Otherwise, push 0
          Execute NEXT
</pre>
<pre>
  dup     Pop a value off the data stack
          Push it back onto data stack
          Push it a second time
          Execute NEXT
</pre>
<pre>
  2dup    Pop two values off the data stack
          Push them back onto data stack, in the same order
          Push them a second time, also in the same order
          Execute NEXT
</pre>
<pre>
  swap    Pop two values off the data stack
          Push them back onto data stack, in the reverse order
          Execute NEXT
</pre>
<p>In many Forth systems -1 is the preferred &ldquo;true&rdquo; value because it is represented (on almost all machines!!) by an all-ones bit pattern, which can be logically ANDed with other values... but we digress. ;-)</p>
<p>From our definition of <code class="forth">(0branch)</code> above it should be clear that <em>any</em> non-zero value is true, and only zero is false.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s write a simple loop. (There is a better, more efficient, and more idiomatic way to do this, but it is outside the scope of this example. ;-)</p>
<pre>
  -8   begin  1 +  dup 0= until
</pre>
<p>This will get compiled to the following &ldquo;address list&rdquo;:</p>
<pre>
  00  address of (lit)
  04  -8
  08  address of (lit)
  0c  1
  10  address of +
  14  address of dup
  18  address of 0=
  1c  address of (0branch)
  20  08
  24  ...
</pre>
<p>We have to <code class="forth">dup</code> the value before we test it with <code class="forth">0=</code> because <code class="forth">0=</code> <em>consumes</em> the value before pushing its true or false flag.</p>
<p>The word <code class="forth">begin</code> compiles no code; it &ldquo;marks&rdquo; the location that <code class="forth">(0branch)</code> later branches back to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve added memory addresses in hex (which assume a byte-addressed machine with 32-bit addresses) to make the branch destination easier to describe.</p>
<p>We write if/then like this:</p>
<pre>
  2dup &lt;  if  swap  then
</pre>
<p>This compiles to the following:</p>
<pre>
  00  address of 2dup
  04  address of &lt;
  08  address of (0branch)
  0c  1c
  10  address of swap
  1c  ...
</pre>
<p>As before, we <code class="forth">2dup</code> the values because <code class="forth">&lt;</code> consumes them.</p>
<p>Like <code class="forth">begin</code>, <code class="forth">then</code> compiles no code; it resolves the forward branch that <code class="forth">if</code> compiled. Words like if, then, begin, and until are called <em>compiling</em> words because they execute at compile time and do something special, like resolve a forward or backward branch address.</p>
<p>Adding an <code class="forth">else</code> clause looks like this:</p>
<pre>
  0= if  4  else  8  then  +
</pre>
<p>This code compiles to:</p>
<pre>
  00  address of 0=
  04  address of (0branch)
  08  1c
  0c  address of (lit)
  10  4
  14  address of (branch)
  18  24
  1c  address of (lit)
  20  8
  24  address of +
  28  ...
</pre>
<p><code class="forth">if</code> compiles the <code class="forth">(0branch)</code>, <code class="forth">else</code> compiles the <code class="forth">(branch)</code> and resolves the forward <code class="forth">(0branch)</code>, and <code class="forth">then</code> resolves the forward <code class="forth">(branch)</code>.</p>
<p>Remember: <code class="forth">(0branch)</code> means branch if <em>false</em>.</p>
